        title: "The Terminal and How Your System Works",
        content: `Every Unix-based system (macOS, Linux, BSD) has two layers you can interact with. The GUI, which is icons, windows, and clicks. And the Terminal, which is the raw engine underneath. Every click in the GUI is actually a command running behind the scenes. The Terminal lets you talk to the OS directly, in its own language.\n\nThink of it like this: the GUI is an automatic car. The Terminal is a manual. More control, steeper learning curve, far more powerful.\n\n**Opening a Terminal**\n\n**On macOS:** Spotlight (Command+Space), type Terminal, hit Enter. Or use iTerm2 if you prefer a better app.\n\n**On Linux:** Depends on the desktop environment. Most distros: right-click desktop and look for "Open Terminal", or press Ctrl+Alt+T (Ubuntu/GNOME), or find it in your applications menu.\n\n**What is a Process?**\n\nEvery time you open an app or the system does something, it creates a process. A process is a running program with its own ID number called a PID (Process ID). Your system has hundreds of processes running simultaneously. Most are invisible background services. Some belong to you, some belong to root.\n\nWho runs a process matters enormously in security. A process running as root has unlimited power over your system. A process running as your user only has your permissions.\n\n**Your First Commands (same on macOS and Linux)**\n\n\`whoami\` prints your current username. Simple, but fundamental. In security, identity is everything.\n\n\`pwd\` (Print Working Directory) tells you which folder you are currently inside. The Terminal always has a current location.\n\n\`ls -la\` lists everything in the current folder. The flags: \`-l\` gives long format showing permissions, owner, size, date. \`-a\` shows all files including hidden ones (files starting with a dot).\n\nReading the permission string \`drwxr-xr-x\`:\n- First character: \`d\` = directory, \`-\` = file, \`l\` = symlink\n- Next 3: owner's permissions (r=read, w=write, x=execute)\n- Next 3: group's permissions\n- Last 3: everyone else's permissions\n\nMalware often hides in files starting with a dot (hidden files) or sets unusual permissions.\n\n**Pipes and Filters (identical on both platforms)**\n\nThe pipe \`|\` takes output from one command and feeds it into another. Like an assembly line.\n\n\`grep\` filters text and only shows lines matching a pattern. \`grep -v\` shows lines that do NOT match (invert). \`grep -i\` is case-insensitive.\n\n\`sudo\` (Super User Do) runs a command as root. Many security commands need this because reading process details and network connections is sensitive. Your system asks for your password to confirm you are authorizing it.`,

You just need to find it.\n\n**ps aux (identical on macOS and Linux)**\n\nThis is the most useful process command. It shows every process running on the system.\n\nThe output columns:\n- \`USER\` — who owns the process\n- \`PID\` — process ID\n- \`%CPU\` and \`%MEM\` — resource usage\n- \`COMMAND\` — what is actually running\n\nRun \`ps aux | grep -v root | grep -v $(whoami)\` to see processes not owned by root or you. Those are worth paying attention to.\n\n**top**\n\n\`top\` gives a live view of the busiest processes. Press \`q\` to quit.\n\n**On macOS:** \`top -o cpu\` sorts by CPU usage at launch. You can also press \`o\` inside top then type \`cpu\` to change sort order interactively.\n\n**On Linux:** \`top\` opens sorted by CPU by default. Press \`P\` to sort by CPU, \`M\` to sort by memory, \`k\` to kill a process by PID. For a friendlier view, install \`htop\` (\`sudo apt install htop\` or \`sudo yum install htop\`).\n\nIf something is using 90% CPU for no reason on either system, investigate it.\n\n**kill and pkill (same on both)**\n\n\`kill PID\` sends a termination signal to the process. The process can ignore it.\n\n\`kill -9 PID\` sends SIGKILL, which forces the process to stop immediately. It cannot be ignored.\n\n\`pkill -f name\` kills all processes whose full command matches the name. Useful when you know the name but not the PID.\n\n**What Suspicious Looks Like**\n\nThings to watch for in your process list (applies to both macOS and Linux):\n- A process with a vague or random-looking name\n- A process using high CPU or memory with no obvious reason\n- A process running as root that you do not recognize\n- Multiple instances of the same process when there should only be one\n- A process whose \`COMMAND\` path is inside /tmp, /dev/shm (Linux), or a user home directory`,

        content: `The Unix filesystem has a specific layout. Knowing it lets you spot things that do not belong. The core structure is the same across macOS and Linux.\n\n**Key Directories (same on macOS and Linux)**\n\n\`/etc\` — system configuration files. passwd, hosts, sudoers. These control how your system behaves at a fundamental level.\n\n\`/var\` — variable data. Logs live in /var/log. Temporary runtime data lives here. High churn directory.\n\n\`/tmp\` — temporary files, cleared on reboot. Anyone can write here. A common malware staging area.\n\n\`/usr\` — user programs. /usr/bin, /usr/sbin. Most system commands live here.\n\n**On Linux only:** \`/dev/shm\` is a RAM-based temporary filesystem. World-writable. Malware uses it to avoid disk writes. \`/proc\` exposes live process and kernel information. \`/opt\` is for optional third-party software.\n\n**On macOS only:** \`/Applications\` holds GUI apps. \`/private\` is the real location of /etc and /var (they are symlinks from the root). \`/System/Library\` contains Apple's own framework and daemon files.\n\n**macOS Persistence Locations**\n\n\`~/Library/LaunchAgents\` — programs that start automatically when you log in. This is where most macOS malware sets up persistence. Any .plist file here runs something on login.\n\n\`/Library/LaunchAgents\` — same, but for all users.\n\n\`/Library/LaunchDaemons\` — system-level startup programs that run even before login.\n\n**Linux Persistence Locations**\n\n\`~/.bashrc\`, \`~/.bash_profile\`, \`~/.profile\` — shell startup files. Adding a malicious command here executes it every time the user opens a terminal.\n\n\`/etc/cron.d/\`, \`/var/spool/cron/crontabs/\` — scheduled task definitions.\n\n\`/etc/systemd/system/\` and \`/lib/systemd/system/\` — systemd service units that start on boot.\n\n\`/etc/init.d/\` and \`/etc/rc.local\` — legacy startup scripts still present on many systems.\n\n**Hidden Files (same on both)**\n\nFiles starting with a dot are hidden from normal \`ls\`. Attackers abuse this. A dotfile in your home directory that you did not create is worth looking at.\n\n**The find Command (same on both)**\n\n\`find\` searches the filesystem. The most useful security uses:\n- Find recently modified files: \`find / -mtime -1 2>/dev/null\`\n- Find files in unexpected locations: \`find /tmp -name "*.sh"\`\n- Find world-writable files: \`find / -perm -002 -type f 2>/dev/null\``,

        content: `Before you can spot suspicious network activity, you need to understand what normal looks like.\n\n**IP Addresses**\n\nEvery device on a network has an IP address. Your Mac has at least two: a local one (e.g., 192.168.1.x) for your home network, and your external public IP when you hit the internet.\n\n\`127.0.0.1\` is localhost. Always points to your own machine. A process talking to 127.0.0.1 is talking to itself (common for local services, databases, etc.).\n\n**Ports**\n\nA port is a numbered channel on an IP address. If an IP address is the building, the port is the apartment number. Both the sender and receiver need to agree on which port to use.\n\nWell-known ports to know:\n- \`22\` — SSH (remote terminal access)\n- \`80\` — HTTP (web, unencrypted)\n- \`443\` — HTTPS (web, encrypted)\n- \`3306\` — MySQL database\n- \`5432\` — PostgreSQL database\n- \`8080 / 8443\` — common alternative web ports\n\nPorts below 1024 require root to open. If you see an unfamiliar process listening on a low port, pay attention.\n\n**TCP vs UDP**\n\nTCP is connection-oriented. It does a handshake, confirms delivery, retransmits lost packets. Web browsing, SSH, file transfers.\n\nUDP is fire-and-forget. Faster, no confirmation. DNS, video streaming, games.\n\nFrom a security view: TCP connections leave clear traces (established connections, source/destination, state). UDP is harder to track.\n\n**What Listening Means**\n\nWhen a process "listens" on a port, it is waiting for incoming connections on that port. If you have a service listening on port 22, someone could potentially SSH into your machine from outside.\n\nListening on 127.0.0.1 means local only. Listening on 0.0.0.0 or your external IP means anyone can attempt to connect.`,

Those are your exposed services.\n\n\`netstat -an | grep LISTEN\` filters to only listening ports. Look at every entry and ask: do I know what this is?\n\nThen look at ESTABLISHED. Those are active connections right now.\n\n\`netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED\` shows who you are currently connected to. Unexpected connections to unfamiliar IPs are worth investigating.\n\n**On macOS**\n\nThe \`netstat\` output on macOS looks slightly different. Use \`netstat -anp tcp\` for TCP only or \`netstat -anp udp\` for UDP. The \`-p\` flag on macOS specifies protocol, not process name (unlike Linux where \`-p\` shows the process).`,

        content: `Persistence is how a malicious program survives a reboot. If you remove it from memory but it has a persistence mechanism, it comes back the next time you restart. Understanding persistence locations is one of the most practical defensive skills. The mechanisms differ significantly between macOS and Linux.\n\n**macOS: LaunchAgents**\n\nLaunchAgents are .plist files that tell macOS to run something automatically. They run in the context of a logged-in user.\n\nLocations to check:\n- \`~/Library/LaunchAgents\` — your user only, runs on your login\n- \`/Library/LaunchAgents\` — all users, runs on any user login\n\nThe .plist file contains a \`Program\` or \`ProgramArguments\` key that points to the binary or script to run.\n\n**macOS: LaunchDaemons**\n\n\`/Library/LaunchDaemons\` — runs as root, even before any user logs in. Higher privilege, higher risk if abused.\n\n\`launchctl list\` shows all currently loaded entries. Filter out Apple's: \`launchctl list | grep -v com.apple\`. What remains is third-party.\n\n**Linux: systemd**\n\nsystemd is the standard init system on modern Linux. Services that run on boot are defined as unit files.\n\n\`/etc/systemd/system/\` — custom and third-party service units. This is where a persistent backdoor would live.\n\n\`systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running\` shows all currently active services.\n\n\`systemctl status servicename\` gives details on a specific service including its unit file path and recent logs.\n\n**Linux: startup files**\n\n\`~/.bashrc\` and \`~/.bash_profile\` run every time a user opens a terminal. Appending a malicious command here is a subtle persistence technique.\n\n\`/etc/profile\` and \`/etc/profile.d/\` run for all users on login.\n\n\`/etc/rc.local\` (older systems) runs commands at boot. Still present on some distros.\n\n**cron (same on both platforms)**\n\n\`cron\` is a scheduler. It runs commands at specified times. \`crontab -l\` shows your scheduled tasks. \`sudo crontab -l\` shows root's scheduled tasks.\n\nA crontab entry looks like: \`* * * * * /path/to/script\`.

        content: `A C2 (Command and Control) channel is the communication link between a compromised system and the attacker's server. Without it, a backdoor is just a dormant file. With it, the attacker can issue commands, receive stolen data, and maintain access indefinitely. Understanding how C2 works is the prerequisite to detecting it.\n\n**The Architecture**\n\nThe implant is the code running on the victim system. It may be a standalone executable, a shared library injected into a legitimate process, or shellcode running purely in memory with no file on disk.\n\nThe handler (also called the teamserver or listener) is the attacker-controlled server. The implant connects outbound to it. This direction matters for detection: you are looking for outbound connections from your machine to external IPs, not inbound connections.\n\n**Beacon vs. Interactive Mode**\n\nMost modern implants use a beacon model. The implant sleeps for a set interval (say, 60 seconds), then wakes up, contacts the handler, checks for instructions, executes any tasks, sends results back, and sleeps again. This produces periodic, low-volume outbound traffic that blends with background noise.\n\nInteractive shells maintain a persistent TCP connection. Easier to detect because the connection stays ESTABLISHED continuously in netstat and lsof.\n\n**Jitter**\n\nOperators add jitter to beacon intervals to defeat timing-based detection. Instead of exactly 60 seconds every call-home, the implant sleeps for 60 seconds plus or minus a random percentage (10% jitter means anywhere from 54 to 66 seconds). This makes simple interval matching unreliable.\n\n**Common C2 Frameworks**\n\nCobalt Strike is the most widely abused commercial red team tool. Its default beacon uses HTTPS. It supports malleable C2 profiles that mimic legitimate CDN or SaaS traffic to blend in.\n\nMetasploit Meterpreter is common in automated exploitation. It connects back on configurable ports and supports staged payloads where a small first-stage downloads the actual implant.\n\nSliver is open-source and growing in use. It supports mutual TLS (mTLS), HTTP, and DNS channels.\n\nCustom implants written by nation-state actors have no public signatures or known patterns.\n\n**C2 Channels**\n\nHTTPS (port 443) is the most common channel. It blends with legitimate web traffic and is rarely blocked. The implant calls out to a hardcoded domain or IP that the attacker controls.\n\nDNS encoding uses DNS query and response fields to carry data. Very hard to block because DNS is fundamental infrastructure. The implant sends data as subdomains of an attacker-controlled domain.\n\nHTTP with custom headers encodes commands in user-agent strings, cookies, or custom header fields, making the traffic look like normal web browsing at first glance.\n\nICMP tunneling routes data through ping packets. Uncommon but used when TCP and UDP are heavily monitored or blocked.`,

Ask yourself: does this process have a legitimate reason to connect to this destination?\n\nSuspicious COMMAND values: bash, sh, python3, python, perl, ruby, nc, ncat, socat, curl used as a persistent process rather than a one-shot request.\n\nSuspicious NAME patterns: high port numbers (50000+), connections to cloud VPS ranges (check with whois), connections at regular intervals.\n\n**Step 2: Check the Process Details**\n\nWhen you find a suspicious connection, note the PID and dig deeper:\n\n\`ps -p PID -o pid,ppid,user,args\`\n\nThe args column shows the full command. \`python3 /tmp/.update.py\` is very different from \`python3 /usr/lib/packagekit/pk-offline-update.py\`.\n\nThe ppid (parent PID) tells you what spawned the suspicious process. If apache2 spawned a bash shell, that is a webshell execution. If sshd spawned python3, something is wrong.\n\n**Step 3: Check for Beaconing Patterns**\n\nA beacon will not always be visible in a single lsof snapshot because it disconnects between calls. Run the check twice with a gap between them:\n\n\`sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep ESTABLISHED > /tmp/check1.txt\`\n\nWait 2-3 minutes. Then:\n\n\`sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep ESTABLISHED > /tmp/check2.txt\`\n\n\`diff /tmp/check1.txt /tmp/check2.txt\`\n\nIf the same destination IP appears in both despite the connection closing and reopening, that is a candidate beacon.\n\n**DNS Anomalies**\n\nDNS-based C2 never appears in netstat or lsof as a TCP connection. You need to look at DNS activity instead.\n\nOn macOS: \`log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.network.dns"' --last 1h | grep -i query\`\n\nOn Linux with systemd-resolved: \`journalctl -u systemd-resolved --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i query\`\n\nAlternatively, check your router's DNS logs if available.\n\nSigns of DNS tunneling: many queries to the same base domain with varying long subdomains, TXT record queries (uncommon in normal traffic), repeated NXDOMAIN responses.\n\n**Checking Connection History in Logs**\n\nOn Linux, if the C2 used SSH or a service that logs, you will find traces in auth.log. But for raw TCP connections, the system does not log every connection by default. You need either a firewall log or network capture.\n\n\`grep -i 'connect' /var/log/syslog | tail -30\` can sometimes surface connection events depending on what services are logging.`,

        title: "Finding Injected Code and Memory-Only Implants",
        content: `Advanced C2 implants do not always drop a file and run it. Instead, they inject their code into a running legitimate process. From ps output, you see the legitimate process name. Inside it, the attacker's code is running. This is harder to detect but not impossible.\n\n**What Process Injection Means**\n\nProcess injection places attacker-controlled code inside the memory space of a legitimate running process. The legitimate process handle in the OS now executes both its original code and the injected payload.\n\nFrom ps, you still see something like /usr/bin/python3 or sshd. The injection is invisible at that level. What leaks is behavior that does not match what the process normally does: outbound network connections, file access in unusual places, unexplained memory growth.\n\n**Process Hollowing**\n\nProcess hollowing starts a legitimate process in a suspended state, unmaps its original code from memory, and writes the attacker's payload into that memory space before resuming it. The process entry in ps shows the original binary name, but it is running completely different code.\n\nIndicators:\n- A process whose binary path is legitimate but lsof -p shows no access to libraries or files you would expect\n- A process making network connections to external IPs when it has no network functionality normally\n\n**Checking for Deleted Binaries (Linux)**\n\nA classic evasion: drop the binary, execute it, then immediately delete the file. The process keeps running from memory. The file is gone from disk.\n\n\`ls -la /proc/PID/exe\`\n\nIf the output shows \`(deleted)\` after the path, the binary on disk was removed after the process started. This is sometimes legitimate (package updates), but in the context of a suspicious process it is a strong indicator.\n\n\`ls -la /proc/*/exe 2>/dev/null | grep deleted\`\n\nThis scans all processes for deleted executable paths.\n\n**Checking Memory Regions (Linux)**\n\n\`/proc/PID/maps\` shows the memory map of a process: every memory region, its permissions, and what file backs it if any.\n\n\`cat /proc/1234/maps | grep rwx\`\n\nLook for regions marked \`rwx\` (read, write, and execute). Legitimate code regions are \`r-x\` (read and execute only). A memory region that is both writable and executable in a process that is not a JVM, browser, or JIT compiler is suspicious. It may contain injected shellcode.\n\n**Parent-Child Process Anomalies**\n\nLegitimate processes have predictable parent-child relationships. Knowing what is normal lets you spot what is not.\n\n\`ps -eo pid,ppid,user,args\`\n\nThings that should raise questions:\n- apache2 or nginx spawning a bash or sh child (webshell execution)\n- A system daemon like sshd or cron spawning python3 or perl with no arguments\n- bash being a child of something other than a terminal or SSH session\n- Multiple instances of a process that should be a singleton\n\n**Signed vs. Unsigned Binaries (macOS)**\n\nOn macOS, legitimate Apple software and most commercial apps are code-signed. An unsigned or ad-hoc signed binary making network connections is worth investigating.\n\n\`codesign -dv --verbose=4 /path/to/binary 2>&1\`\n\nIf the output shows \`not signed\` or an ad-hoc signature with no team identifier, the binary has no verified origin.\n\n**Memory-Only Implants**\n\nSome implants are loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or abusing a legitimate mechanism (a malicious shared library, a malicious Perl module, a Python package) and never write a standalone executable to disk.\n\nOn Linux, check what shared libraries a process has mapped:\n\n\`cat /proc/PID/maps | grep '\\.so'\`\n\nA path like /tmp/libupdate.so.1 or a .so in a home directory is a strong indicator. Legitimate shared libraries live in /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib.`,
