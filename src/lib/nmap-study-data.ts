        title: "Introduction to Nmap",
        content: `Nmap (Network Mapper) is the world's most widely used open-source network scanner, originally created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor) in 1997. It is a staple tool for security professionals, penetration testers, and network administrators to discover hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities across a network.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Host discovery**, determine which hosts are online
- **Port scanning**, identify open, closed, and filtered ports
- **Service & version detection**, identify what software is listening on each port
- **OS fingerprinting**, estimate the operating system and version of a target
- **Scriptable interaction**, automate tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

**Basic Syntax:**
\`\`\`
nmap [scan type] [options] {target specification}
\`\`\`

**Installation:**
- Debian/Ubuntu: \`sudo apt install nmap\`
- RHEL/Fedora: \`sudo dnf install nmap\`
- macOS: \`brew install nmap\`
- Windows: Download the installer from nmap.org (includes Zenmap GUI)

**Privilege Levels:**
Many scan types such as SYN scan (\`-sS\`) require root/administrator privileges because they craft raw IP packets at a low level. TCP Connect scan (\`-sT\`) works without root by using the OS's standard connect() syscall. Running \`sudo nmap\` on Linux or running as Administrator on Windows unlocks full functionality.

**Legal and Ethical Notice:**
Scanning any network without written authorization from the owner is illegal in most jurisdictions and can violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US) and similar laws worldwide. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning. Even port scanning your own production systems without a maintenance window can trigger firewalls and IDS alerts.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Network asset inventory and mapping
- Pre-engagement reconnaissance in penetration tests
- Verifying firewall rules and ACL configurations
- Monitoring service availability
- Compliance auditing (PCI-DSS, HIPAA)`,

        title: "Target Specification",
        content: `Nmap supports a wide range of target specification formats, making it flexible for scanning individual hosts, subnets, or complex multi-range networks.

**Single Host:**
Specify a hostname (\`nmap scanme.nmap.org\`), IPv4 address (\`nmap 192.168.1.1\`), or IPv6 address (\`nmap -6 ::1\`).

**CIDR Notation:**
Scan an entire subnet by appending the prefix length. \`nmap 192.168.1.0/24\` scans all 256 addresses in the subnet (192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.255). \`nmap 10.0.0.0/8\` scans 16.7 million addresses, only do this with permission and appropriate timing.

**IP Ranges:**
Use a hyphen to specify a range within an octet: \`nmap 192.168.1.1-50\` scans .1 through .50.
Mix multiple formats: \`nmap 192.168.1.1,5,10-20\` scans .1, .5, and .10 through .20.

**Wildcard:**
\`nmap 192.168.1.*\` is equivalent to \`192.168.1.0/24\`.

**Input from File (\`-iL\`):**
Store targets one per line (or space/comma-separated) in a text file and pass it with \`-iL targets.txt\`. This is useful for large engagements.

**Excluding Targets (\`--exclude\`, \`--excludefile\`):**
Exclude specific hosts or ranges from a scan: \`nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.254\`. Use \`--excludefile\` to specify a file of exclusions. This is critical when production-critical hosts must be protected.

**Random Targets (\`-iR\`):**
\`nmap -iR 100\` selects 100 random Internet hosts. Useful for research but must only be used ethically and with great care.

**Resolving Hostnames:**
Nmap resolves hostnames by default. Disable with \`-n\` (no DNS resolution) to speed up scans significantly on large ranges.`,

        slug: "port-states",
        title: "Understanding Port States",
        content: `Nmap categorizes ports into six possible states based on the responses (or lack thereof) it receives during scanning. Understanding these states is fundamental to interpreting Nmap output correctly.

**Open:**
An application is actively accepting connections on this port. A service (e.g., Apache on TCP 80, SSH on TCP 22) is listening. This is the most interesting state from a security perspective, open ports represent potential attack surface.

**Closed:**
The port is accessible (not filtered by a firewall), but no application is currently listening on it. The host is reachable and the port responds, but returns a TCP RST (reset) for TCP or an ICMP port unreachable for UDP. Useful for OS detection.

**Filtered:**
Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because a packet filter (firewall, router ACL) is dropping or rejecting packets destined for this port. Nmap doesn't receive any response, or receives ICMP unreachable error type 3, code 1/2/3/9/10/13. Filtered ports slow down scans significantly.

**Unfiltered:**
The port is accessible but Nmap cannot determine if it is open or closed. This state only appears with ACK scan (\`-sA\`), which is used to map firewall rules. The host responds to the ACK probe but the state of the application is indeterminate.

**Open|Filtered:**
Nmap cannot determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs with scan types where open and filtered ports give the same response (no response). Common with UDP, FIN, NULL, and XMAS scans. If an open port receives a FIN packet, it silently drops it, same as a filtered port.

**Closed|Filtered:**
Nmap cannot determine whether a port is closed or filtered. Only appears with IP ID idle scan (\`-sI\`).

**Practical Takeaway:**
In most penetration tests, the states of interest are **open** (service is running) and **filtered** (firewall is protecting it). A filtered port that you can reach via a different technique may reveal a hidden service.`,

    topics: [
      {
        slug: "host-discovery",
        title: "Host Discovery",
        content: `Host discovery is the process of determining which hosts are online before investing time in port scanning. Nmap offers numerous host discovery techniques, each suited to different network environments and firewall configurations.

**Ping Scan Only (\`-sn\`):**
Also called a ping sweep. Nmap sends probes but doesn't scan ports. It simply reports which hosts are up. Fast and non-intrusive for mapping live hosts on a subnet.

**Skip Host Discovery (\`-Pn\`):**
Treat all hosts as online, skip the discovery phase and proceed directly to port scanning. Essential when targets are behind firewalls that block all ping probes. Slower on large ranges (scans all hosts even if offline).

**ICMP Probes:**
- \`-PE\`, ICMP echo request (classic "ping")
- \`-PP\`, ICMP timestamp request (sometimes passes firewalls that block echo)
- \`-PM\`, ICMP address mask request

**TCP Probes:**
- \`-PS[portlist]\`, TCP SYN probe (default port 80). A SYN/ACK (open) or RST (closed) indicates host is up
- \`-PA[portlist]\`, TCP ACK probe (default port 80). RST response indicates host is up (useful when SYN is blocked)

**UDP Probes:**
- \`-PU[portlist]\`, UDP probe (default port 40125). ICMP port unreachable = host is up

**ARP Ping (\`-PR\`):**
Used automatically on local networks. Sends ARP requests, which are reliable and fast. Cannot be blocked by host-based firewalls. Nmap uses ARP by default when scanning local subnets with root privilege.

**No DNS Resolution (\`-n\`):**
Always combine with host discovery on large ranges to avoid slow reverse DNS lookups.

**Firewall Bypass Strategy:**
When ICMP is blocked, try \`-PS443\`, \`-PA80\`, or \`-PU53\`. Different probes have different chances of passing through firewalls.`,

        content: `By default, Nmap scans the 1000 most common TCP ports (according to nmap-services data). Understanding how to control port selection is critical for effective and efficient scanning.

**Default Scan:**
Without any \`-p\` flag, Nmap scans the top 1000 ports ranked by frequency of use in the nmap-services file. This covers the most common services.

**Specific Ports (\`-p\`):**
- Single port: \`-p 80\`
- Multiple ports: \`-p 22,80,443\`
- Range: \`-p 1-1024\`
- All 65535 ports: \`-p-\` or \`-p 1-65535\`

- Protocol-prefixed: \`-p T:80,U:53\` for TCP 80 and UDP 53 together

**Top N Ports (\`--top-ports\`):**
\`--top-ports 100\` scans the 100 most commonly open ports. \`--top-ports 1000\` is the default. More focused and faster than a full scan.

**Port Ratio (\`--port-ratio\`):**
\`--port-ratio 0.01\` scans only ports with an open frequency greater than 1%. Useful for targeted scans.

**Fast Scan (\`-F\`):**
Scans only the top 100 ports. Significantly faster than the default top 1000.

**Exclude Ports (\`--exclude-ports\`):**
Exclude specific ports from a scan to avoid disrupting sensitive services.

        title: "TCP Scanning Methods",
        content: `Nmap provides multiple TCP scanning techniques, each with different stealth levels, reliability, and privilege requirements. Understanding which to use in which situation is a key skill.

**SYN Scan (\`-sS\`), Half-open / Stealth Scan:**
The default scan type when run as root. Sends a SYN packet and waits for a response:
- SYN/ACK received → port is **open** (Nmap sends RST, connection never completes)
- RST received → port is **closed**
- No response / ICMP unreachable → port is **filtered**
Faster than Connect scan and less likely to be logged since the three-way handshake is never completed. Requires raw packet privileges.

**TCP Connect Scan (\`-sT\`), Full Connection:**
Uses the OS's \`connect()\` syscall to complete the full TCP three-way handshake. Works without root privileges. More likely to be logged by target firewalls and applications. Slower than SYN scan. Used when raw packet access is unavailable.

**ACK Scan (\`-sA\`), Firewall Rule Mapping:**
Sends ACK packets (which appear to be part of established sessions). Always returns RST (port never appears open). Used to determine if ports are **filtered** or **unfiltered** (not to find open ports). Excellent for mapping stateful firewall rules.

**NULL Scan (\`-sN\`):**
Sends a TCP segment with no flags set. Open/filtered ports give no response; closed ports return RST. Bypasses some non-stateful packet filters and can evade certain IDSes. May not work against Windows targets (which ignore the RFC 793 spec).

**FIN Scan (\`-sF\`):**
Sends a TCP FIN packet. Similar behavior to NULL: closed ports respond with RST, open ports are silent. Can bypass some firewalls. Doesn't work reliably on Windows.

**XMAS Scan (\`-sX\`):**
Sets FIN, PSH, and URG flags (lights up like a Christmas tree). Same behavior as NULL/FIN. Historical IDS evasion technique; modern IDSes detect it.

**Maimon Scan (\`-sM\`):**
Sends FIN/ACK. Similar to NULL/FIN/XMAS. Originally worked on some BSD systems.

**Window Scan (\`-sW\`):**
Same as ACK but uses the TCP window size to differentiate open vs. closed (exploits a quirk in some TCP implementations). Works on a small number of systems.`,

        title: "UDP Scanning",
        content: `UDP scanning is one of the most challenging aspects of network reconnaissance because UDP is a connectionless protocol, there is no handshake to reliably detect an open port.

**How UDP Scan Works (\`-sU\`):**
Nmap sends a UDP packet to each target port. The response determines the state:
- ICMP port unreachable (type 3, code 3) → port is **closed**
- ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1/2/9/10/13) → port is **filtered**
- Any UDP response → port is **open**
- No response → port is **open|filtered** (most common result)

**Why UDP is Slow:**
Because no response = open|filtered, Nmap must wait for timeouts. The Linux kernel also rate-limits ICMP unreachable messages to ~1/second by default, which makes scanning 65535 UDP ports take over 18 hours. Nmap works around this by tracking and throttling its probe rate.

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. Limit to common UDP ports: \`-sU --top-ports 20\`
2. Combine with version detection: \`-sU -sV\`, some UDP services respond to specific protocol probes (NSE scripts)
3. Use higher timing: \`-sU -T4\`
4. Combine with TCP: \`-sSU -T4 -p T:1-1000,U:53,67,68,69,161,162\`

**Important UDP Services:**
| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 53 | DNS |
| 67/68 | DHCP |
| 69 | TFTP |
| 123 | NTP |
| 161/162 | SNMP |
| 514 | Syslog |
| 1194 | OpenVPN |

**SNMP (UDP 161) is particularly valuable:**
SNMP can leak enormous amounts of system info if community strings are default ("public", "private"). Always scan UDP 161.`,

        title: "Service & Version Detection",
        content: `Service and version detection allows Nmap to go beyond identifying open ports and determine exactly what software and version is running on each port. This is critical for identifying vulnerable software versions.

**Version Detection (\`-sV\`):**
After discovering open ports, Nmap sends protocol-specific probes and matches responses against the \`nmap-service-probes\` database (thousands of signatures). Output includes:
- Service name (e.g., "Apache httpd")
- Version number (e.g., "2.4.50")
- Extra info (e.g., "(Ubuntu)")
- Confidence level

**Intensity Levels (\`--version-intensity 0-9\`):**
Controls how aggressively Nmap probes:
- \`0\`, only light probes, fastest
- \`5\`, default
- \`9\`, all probes, slowest but most thorough

**Light/Default/All shortcuts:**
- \`--version-light\` → intensity 2
- \`--version-all\` → intensity 9

**Aggressive Scan (\`-A\`):**
Enables version detection (-sV), OS detection (-O), script scanning (-sC), and traceroute in one flag. The go-to for comprehensive scanning.

**Banner Grabbing:**
Version detection often captures service banners, the text a service sends when you connect. Banners can reveal software name, version, and OS. Nmap also uses version probes to trigger more specific responses.

**CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):**
Version detection output often includes CPE strings (e.g., \`cpe:/a:apache:http_server:2.4.50\`) which can be used to look up CVEs in vulnerability databases.

**Practical Example:**
\`nmap -sV --version-intensity 7 -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1\`
This might return: \`22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu (protocol 2.0)\``,

        title: "OS Detection",
        content: `OS detection allows Nmap to determine the operating system, version, and sometimes the device type of a target by analyzing responses to carefully crafted probe packets. This capability relies on the fact that different OS TCP/IP stack implementations respond to unusual packets in different ways.

**Enabling OS Detection (\`-O\`):**
Nmap sends a series of TCP, UDP, and ICMP probes to an open and a closed port on the target. It analyzes:
- TCP ISN (Initial Sequence Number) generation patterns
- TCP options and their ordering (MSS, SACK, timestamps, window size)
- ICMP response characteristics
- IP TTL and window size values

**Requirements:**
- At least one open and one closed TCP port must be found (use \`-p 1-1000\` or ensure ports are in scope)
- Requires root/administrator privileges

**OS Guess Confidence:**
Results show a confidence percentage and multiple possible OS matches ranked by likelihood. A 96%+ match is considered reliable. Lower confidence = OS is unusual or behind a firewall/NAT.

**Aggressive OS Detection (\`--osscan-guess\` / \`--fuzzy\`):**
Forces Nmap to report its best OS guess even when confidence is low. Useful as a starting point but results may be inaccurate.

**Limiting OS Detection (\`--osscan-limit\`):**
Skip OS detection on hosts that don't have both an open and closed port. Speeds up large-range scans.

**-A Flag:**
Combines OS detection, version detection, scripts, and traceroute. The most comprehensive single-flag option.

**Device Type Detection:**
Along with OS, Nmap often reports device type: general purpose, router, firewall, webcam, phone, etc. Useful for network mapping.

**Limitations:**
- Firewalls and NAT devices can skew OS fingerprinting
- Virtual machines and containers may report the hypervisor's TCP stack
- IDS systems may detect OS fingerprinting probes`,

**Script Categories:**
Scripts are organized into categories. A script can belong to multiple categories:
- \`auth\`, authentication bypass and credential testing
- \`broadcast\`, discover hosts via broadcast messages
- \`brute\`, brute-force credential attacks
- \`default\`, run when using -sC or -A (safe, useful scripts)
- \`discovery\`, service information gathering
- \`dos\`, denial-of-service attacks (dangerous, use with extreme caution)

- \`fuzzer\`, send malformed packets for fuzzing
- \`intrusive\`, likely to crash services or be logged, not in default
- \`malware\`, detect malware backdoors
- \`safe\`, unlikely to crash services or be logged

        title: "Timing & Performance",
        content: `Nmap's timing controls let you balance scan speed against stealth, accuracy, and network impact. Understanding timing is essential for both efficient legitimate scanning and evasive penetration testing.

**Timing Templates (\`-T0\` to \`-T5\`):**
Nmap provides six timing templates that adjust multiple timing parameters simultaneously:

| Template | Name | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|
| \`-T0\` | Paranoid | IDS evasion, sends one packet every 5 minutes |
| \`-T1\` | Sneaky | Slow IDS evasion, one packet every 15 seconds |
| \`-T2\` | Polite | Minimal network impact, slows scan by 10x |
| \`-T3\` | Normal | Default, balanced speed and reliability |
| \`-T4\` | Aggressive | Faster scans on reliable networks (LAN/fast internet) |
| \`-T5\` | Insane | Maximum speed, may miss results on slow networks |

**Fine-Grained Control:**
- \`--min-rate <n>\`, send at least n packets per second
- \`--max-rate <n>\`, send at most n packets per second
- \`--max-retries <n>\`, limit probe retransmissions (default varies, use 2 for speed)
- \`--max-rtt-timeout <time>\`, maximum round-trip timeout
- \`--min-hostgroup <n>\`, scan at least n hosts in parallel
- \`--max-hostgroup <n>\`, scan at most n hosts in parallel
- \`--max-parallelism <n>\`, cap the number of parallel probes

**Recommended Combinations:**
- Fast legitimate scan: \`-T4 --min-rate 1000 --max-retries 3\`
- Full stealth: \`-T1 -f --data-length 24\`
- Quick sweep: \`-T4 -F\` (top 100 ports quickly)
- Full TCP: \`-p- -T4 --min-rate 5000\`

**Why -T4 is common:**
-T4 is the recommended setting for most modern networks. It sets aggressive but not extreme timing, and is suitable for pentests on LANs and cloud instances.

**Timing and IDS:**
-T0 and -T1 spread packets over long periods to avoid triggering IDS threshold-based alerts. However, modern behavioral IDS systems can still detect slow scans.`,

        title: "Firewall/IDS Evasion",
        content: `Nmap includes several techniques designed to bypass firewalls, evade intrusion detection systems (IDS), and obscure the source of a scan. These are critical skills in penetration testing but must only be used against systems you have explicit authorization to test.

**Packet Fragmentation (\`-f\`):**
Splits IP packets into tiny 8-byte fragments. Many older firewalls and packet filters can't reassemble fragments for inspection. Double fragmentation (\`-ff\` or \`--mtu 16\`) uses 16-byte fragments. Requires raw socket access.

**Decoy Scanning (\`-D\`):**
Sends scan packets that appear to come from multiple IP addresses simultaneously. Real scan mixed with decoy traffic: \`-D RND:10\` uses 10 random decoys, \`-D 192.168.1.5,ME,192.168.1.7\` places your real IP (ME) among two decoys. The target sees multiple scanners and can't easily identify the real source. Doesn't work with OS detection or version scanning.

**Source IP Spoofing (\`-S\`):**
Spoof the source IP address. Requires specifying an interface (\`-e eth0\`) and disabling ICMP pings (\`-Pn\`). Results won't be received (RSTs go to the spoofed IP). Useful to attribute scans to a specific IP or for idle scans.

**Source Port Manipulation (\`--source-port\` / \`-g\`):**
Some firewalls allow traffic from trusted source ports (DNS port 53, HTTP 80). \`--source-port 53\` may bypass rules that trust DNS return traffic. Many firewalls are vulnerable to this.

**Random Data Length (\`--data-length\`):**
Appends random padding bytes to packets to make them appear less like Nmap probes. Hides the characteristic small packet sizes.

**MAC Spoofing (\`--spoof-mac\`):**
Change source MAC address: \`--spoof-mac 0\` uses a random MAC, \`--spoof-mac Apple\` generates a MAC with Apple's OUI. Effective on local network segments only.

**Idle Scan / Zombie Scan (\`-sI\`):**
One of the most advanced and stealthy scan types. Uses a "zombie" host (a quiet machine with predictable IP ID increments) to perform a port scan. The target never sees your real IP. Fully blind scan: \`nmap -sI zombie_ip target_ip\`.

**Proxies (\`--proxies\`):**
Route Nmap traffic through HTTP/SOCKS4 proxies. Useful for attribution hiding.

**Firewall ACK Bypass (\`-sA\`):**
ACK packets often pass through firewalls that only filter incoming SYN packets (stateless firewalls). Useful to map which ports are reachable.`,
